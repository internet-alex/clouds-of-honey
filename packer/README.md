Packer, by Hashicorp, is a command-line tool for quickly creating identical machine images for multiple platforms and environments. 
With Packer, you use a configuration file, called a template, to create a machine image containing a preconfigured operating system and software. 
You can then use this image to create new machines. You can even use a single template to orchestrate the simultaneous creation of your production, staging, and development environments.
